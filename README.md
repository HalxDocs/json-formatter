🌟 JSON Formatter — Developer Edition
Made simple. Made beautiful. Made for everyone.

This tool was created because JSON is everywhere, but working with it can be annoying, confusing, or exhausting — especially when you’re dealing with thousands or even tens of thousands of lines.

This app turns that pain into power.
Paste JSON → press a button → done.
Fast. Clean. Beautiful.

💡 Why This Tool Was Built (The Real Story)

This project started because HalxDocs was formatting extremely large JSON files from the Bible project — sometimes 50,000+ lines.

Manually trying to format it…
Manually trying to convert it…
Manually finding errors…
Manually trying to create TypeScript types…
Manually trying to compare differences…

It was slow.
It was stressful.
And existing online tools were:

❌ laggy
❌ full of ads
❌ not beautiful
❌ not developer-friendly
❌ not powerful enough
❌ crashing on big files

So instead of suffering —

👉 HalxDocs built his own tool.

A tool that is:

modern

fast

beautiful

developer-focused

capable of handling huge JSON files

reliable

and customizable

Built with the real-life pain of working with Bible JSON data at massive scale.

This is a tool made by a developer who faced a real problem —
and decided to solve it permanently.
